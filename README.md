# Genuine Repository

All statistical analysis are done in the P folder. The project will be added to the R\nWorklist version available for
any interested party.


THE RE project folder has the traditional Pyram package with the SMP library.
The project structure will be modified as we proceed and near its completion.
I'm using this structure to perform inferences and several assessments specific to the Pyram exercises. The Pyram package will be added to the project to assist with various aspects of the project. There are several scripts maintained to the project that are called by whenever there is a need to update the Project with new data or with some debug or validation.

```{r}

```{r}
genuine = function(x) {
  res = list(a, b, c)
  result = res
x}

print(genuine(1, thema=illus carvorna theridos per studio) )
```
