# Genuine Experiment Statistical Analysis

This repository contains statistical analyses conducted on data from the Genuine experiment. The analyses are performed using R programming language. Currently, all statistical scripts and related files are stored in the R folder. Additionally, a Psychopy folder with the experiment files will be pushed later.

## R Folder

The R folder contains all the scripts, datasets, and related files for conducting statistical analyses on the Genuine experiment data. To effectively use these scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Download the entire R folder**: To ensure that all dependencies and necessary files are included, it's recommended to download the entire R folder rather than individual files.

2. **Open the R Project file**: This repository includes an R Project file (`Genuine_Experiment.Rproj`). Opening this file in RStudio will set the working directory to the R folder automatically, ensuring that all relative paths within the scripts are correctly referenced.

3. **Execute the scripts**: Within RStudio, navigate to the `Scripts` directory and open the desired R script (`.R` files) for the analysis you wish to perform. Follow the instructions provided within each script to execute the analysis steps.

4. **Review the output**: After executing the scripts, review the output generated, which may include statistical summaries, plots, or other relevant information depending on the analysis conducted.

## Psychopy Folder (Coming Soon)

The Psychopy folder will contain the experiment files for the Genuine experiment. These files will be pushed to the repository at a later time.
